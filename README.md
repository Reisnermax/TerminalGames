# TerminalGames
These are for when you're bored and just for fun

Ipod Submarine:

Client: python iPod_Submarine_Client.py [ip of host] [username]
Host: python iPod_Submarine_Host.py

They all use standard python libraries (curses, random, etc) so they should work in most terminals

Run with python [game].py
